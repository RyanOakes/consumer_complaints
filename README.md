#Consumer Complaints

##Task

Utilize pandas to read/analyze data from the CFPB Consumser Complaint Database -
a collection of all complaints made by American consumers to the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau.

The following info was charted within the program:
-Number of complaints by product
-Number of complaints by company (top 10 companies only)
-Number of complaints by company response
-Mean number of complaints by day of week


##Objectives
-Be able to read in CSV files using pandas
-Be able to pull out and summarize data
-Be able to turn pandas data frames into charts

##Environment
This program was designed with Python 3.5 and utilizes mathlib and seaborn imports.
The primary Github repo contains the README.md file (surprise - you're already here!),
a requirements.txt file listing required software to run, and a Jupyter (iPython)
notebook containing the actual anaylsis and graphs. The complaints were imported
from the CSV file located within.
